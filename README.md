About Me
Hey! Welcome back. If you haven't been here before I am Trent, a 26 year old Hoosier based now in Nashville. This was by far my hardest assignment yet, but it fully functions and I am happy with that!

This project was actually pretty difficult for me as I have been struggling with Javascript. I like the functionality of the finished project and feel good about what I have made.
